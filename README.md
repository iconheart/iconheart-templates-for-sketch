Icon Heart Sketch App Templates
===============================

Mysterious Library folder
------------------------

To install Icon Heart templates for Sketch you have to find Library folder first. 

Library is a hidden directory located in user's home folder. There are many ways to find it:

- You can open it from Finder by choosing `Go` in Main Menu and pressing `option` (`alt`) key.
- Press `cmd+shift+G` and type in `~/Library` (or simply type `~/Lib` and press `Tab`) in Finder.
- `cd ~/Library` command will take you to the rabbit hole if you know secrets of command line.

Installation
------------
Installation is simple and requires two steps. 

First you have to clone (or download) templates. Copy and paste this command into the terminal, then press `Enter`

`\curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iconheart/iconheart-templates-for-sketch/master/get | python`

This command clones entire repository to `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Templates`. 

You can also download files manually and copy them to `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Templates` yourself.

Once files are in place, you should be able to choose one of Icon Heart templates (Icon for Android, Icon for iOS, Icon for Windows) via `File - New From Template - iconheart-templates-for-sketch` in Main Menu.

At last lets create something cool! It would be great if you share your work with us!
